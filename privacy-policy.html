            <h3>1. YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT</h3>
            
            <p>

                policy sets out how we manage your personal information. Please read it 
                carefully. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When you contact Barter, including by posting your goods, exchanging goods, 
                joinging Barter or applying to join Barter team, you agree to this Privacy
                Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                You do not have to provide your personal information to Barter if you don't 
                want to. However, if you don't provide the personal information that Barter
                asks for, that mignt be impossible for Barter to engage with you. For example,
                if you exchange a good without providing your personal address, it might be 
                impossible for Barter to be able to deliver the goods to you.

            <h3>2. WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ?</h3>
            
            <p>
                The personal information we talked about mean the information including your 
                address or phone number and also an opinion about an individual. That individual 
                may either be identified, that is, we know who they are, or reasonably identifiable, 
                which means that we can work out who they are from other information that we have. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The basic idea is, if some organisation for example Barter collects information about
                you, and that organisation is able to link that information with you, then this information
                will be your personal information.
